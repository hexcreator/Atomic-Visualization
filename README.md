Atomic Visualization in Three.js is an interactive project aimed at educators, students, and enthusiasts looking to explore atomic structures in 3D. Utilizing Three.js, this tool provides a hands-on approach to understanding atoms, with configurable parameters such as atomic number, animation smoothness, and more. You can also generate nice looking animations that you can record, share, and use for whatever you desire.

Play with it:

ðŸ”— https://jsfiddle.net/0xhex/wnh04xvo/102/ <br>
ðŸ”— https://codepen.io/vead/pen/ZEmZoMb

Left click to rotate/pivot, and right click to pan/drag. Use your wheel to zoom in. Change the configs around to explore. If you want to download clips, you'll have to clone this repo and run it locally.

## 1. What the Program Is

This program is an interactive visualization of atomic structures, created using Three.js. It showcases a 3D model of an atom with configurable parameters such as atomic number, animation smoothness, and more. You can change the atomic number to visualize different elements, zoom in and out, and enable or disable animations.

The nucleus is depicted as a sphere at the center, and the electrons are represented as spheres orbiting in different shells. The program also includes a user interface that allows you to modify various properties of the visualization.

## 2. Disclaimers about Accuracy

While aiming for visual appeal and educational value, it's important to understand that this visualization is a simplified model and does not represent the complex nature of atoms in accordance with quantum mechanics.

- Classical depiction of electron paths.
- Shapes and sizes chosen for visual appeal, not scientific accuracy.
- No consideration of actual energy levels, electron spin, etc.

## 3. How it Works

The visualization is built using Three.js, a popular library for creating 3D content in the browser. The main components include:

- **Nucleus:** A central sphere representing the nucleus.
- **Electrons:** Spheres that orbit the nucleus in different shells, each with a distinct color.
- **Animation:** An optional animation to make the electrons move in their orbits.
- **User Interface:** A GUI that allows users to change the atomic number, ability to freeze the animation, rotation speed, animation-related values, and other settings.

## 4. How to Use It

To run the program, ensure your web browser supports WebGL:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:** Get the code from this repo.
2. **Open `index.html` in a Browser:** Directly or via a local server.
3. **Interact with the GUI:** Change atomic number, animation, etc.
4. **Mouse Controls:** Pan and zoom with your mouse. Right click to drag and left click to rotate. Use your wheel to zoom in or out.

Feel free to explore different elements and settings to see how the visualization changes.
